## Usage

**IMPORTANT** You shouldn't change profiles in-game. Best way to do it would be to go into practice tool set the settings that you like in game and then add those settings as a profile after you laeve the game.

#### Finding League of Legends folder

If League of Legends is not installed not installed at the default directory you will have to select it manually.

To find where the game is installed Go to Riot Client > Settings > League of Legends > Install directory

#### Locking settings

Lock settings checkbox locks settings making the settings reset to the state you locked them in after every game and after switching to any account on the same computer.

Changing profiles is still possible while this setting is on, the same rules will apply after using a profile.

#### Adding current settings as a profile

Press the plus button in the top row to add settings profile.

**IMPORTANT:** This only saves the settings from the time you pressed the button, any changes after won't be saved to the profile, you will have to add a new profile to save them.

#### Importing settings

Press the import button in the top row to import settings from a `.zip` file.

#### Exporting settings

#### Changing profile

To use settings from a profile press the use button (second button from the left)

## Contributing / Feedback

This is a passion project that I want to put on my resume, so I am currently not accepting code contributions. This might change if the project gets larger, but at this time there are changes I want to make myself and I don't see a point in taking contributions.

On the other hand all feedback is welcome, if there is a feature or change you would like to see feel free to open an issue. If the project grows in scale there will be a better way to give feedback.
